-Initial commit
	v1.0-ALPHA
	Everything I've done so far.
-Update 1.1
	v1.1-ALPHA
	Improved command system - still doesn't work properly when arguments are incorrect... Will be fixed in next update!
		Commands now work using "Nodes" which define specifically how commands should be used.
		This helps make new commands with easy and extendable messages!
	Skins overhaul:
		Skins no longer give players an actual item of the skin.
		Everything now works with packets! - STILL IN TEST PHASE, A LOT MORE WORK TO BE DONE FOR POLISHING!
		Skins are now saved in a file!
		Skins now work with classes rather than a million HashMaps and Lists!
	This version is very buggy compared to the old one, but has a much better structure. It will be fixed soon.
